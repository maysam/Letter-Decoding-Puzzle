-a timer and a stop button. Timer is red until all red highlights are gone. Then it turns green and a stop button appears next to the timer.
When a player clicks on the stop button the timer stops and no further score is added. 

-Ability to auto submit high score, time and game settings to database. (Name, email, Number of words, time to complete, score.) 
There would be a high score ranking for each of the "number of words" setting. So there's a high score for the 9 word games, the 10 word games and so on.
The program would check the database to see if a high score has been achieved, if so the details are sent to the database and the player is notified. It would also check for best time. if a time record is achieved then details are sent to the database and the player is notified.

Prepare for mobile version:
-Resize for iPhone- allow for 50pixels height of ad space at bottom of screen
-remove Logo,score and the side buttons and replace with a settings button at the bottom of the screen. When clicked on a new screen appears :

I would like the default number of words to be set initially to 15 in the game. But still have the option to change in settings. Also please remove duplicate words.


   The score would only be submitted upon clicking "STOP", so only completed games would be eligible as the stop button only appears when all red highlights are gone.

9 Word Puzzles
1-Score: 56, Time: 10:22  Players Name
2-Score: 56, Time: 12:31           "
3-Score: 54, Time:  9:43            "

10 Word Puzzles
1-Score: 51, Time: 13:22  Players Name
2-Score: 50, Time: 10:31            "
3-Score: 49, Time:  9:33             "

Score determines placing and if same score then the time determines first place. 

Web interface. I would like to show the high scores on a webpage.

                for the iPhone version I am wondering if it would be better to limit the word length to 6 letters max, because of the limited screen space.
